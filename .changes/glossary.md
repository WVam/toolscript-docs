# Style guide 

The AACS Documentation was changed to follow this style guide. Most glossary-like parts were extrapolated from indications by the developer as well as use of words throughout the documentation.

# Formatting
- Bold is used for emphasis.
- Monospace is used for parameters and charactres/groups of character that are significant to the syntax (e.g.: `->`).
- Code blocks are used for script.
- Block quotes are used for notes.
- Headers are used for headers.
- Instruction names always link to their respective page.

## Structure-related terminology
Here, this documentation's established terminology has been changed to match more widespread terminology.
- What is contained in a single page is called a **page**.
- What is contained between two h2 headers is called a **section**.
- What is contained between a header of level h3 or lower and the next header of the same or higher level is called a **subsection**.

## Command words et similia

To express certain concepts, only certain words will be used.

- **abbr.**: introduces an abbreviation.
- **can**: introduces something that can be done optionally. Do not use in alternative options one of which MUST be chosen (use "need to either... or...".
- **e.g.**: introduces an example in brackets.
- **for example**/**for instance**: introduces an example.
- **i.e.**: introduces an explaination.
- **if**: introduces a protasis, a comma separates the apodosis if it comes after the protasis.
- **in order to**: introduces a final clause.
- **might**: introduces something that might happen or an uncertain consequence.
- **must**: introduces a necessary condition.
- **should**: introduces a suggestion.
- **will**: introduces a certain consequence (using 1st-type conditional clauses).

Higlight "not" or the words above when particularly important by writing it in uppercase and bold (**NOT**). For "cannot", use "**CANNOT**".
