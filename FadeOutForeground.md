### Examples:

1:  FadeOutForeground:[3000];
```

#### Example #2: Fading out the foreground over the span of 1 second.

### Remarks:
If you pass an empty parameter as `Duration`, it will default to one second (1000 milliseconds).  
The minimum value for `Duration` is 10. If you use a value lower than 10, it will be considered as 10. The only exception to this is 0, which makes the foreground disappear instantly.
